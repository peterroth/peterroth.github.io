# It's Peter Roth's website

Hello and welcome. I'll use this page to share ideas and experiences not only about my profession, IT, but about my hobbys as well, furthermore it will provide my actual Curriculum Vitae.

## Credits  

The design is based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo), used a few colors from [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight).  
Tagging was done with the help of [Long Qian's article](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag), searchbar by Christian Fei's [Simple-Jekyll-Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).
