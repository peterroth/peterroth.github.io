Due to COVID, I'm working from home for about a year (and will remain home for another 8 months as it seems). I didn't expect I must do it so long, and during this time a lot of things changed. For example, I don't have the 2 hours commuting (walk, train, metro) every day. I tried to adjust to the new situation as much as I can, picking up new habits, moving sleeping schedule and so on.  
Because I'm always at home and I receive a lot of messages, my phone was beeping continuously. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (sonar sound), Facebook Messenger (the old [MSN sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RD4RnaWFgY)), Viber (tweeting birds), e-mails ([Diablo 2 portal enter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl6HFv47irc)), SMSes, calls, etc, and there's no feature to mute the phone for a set timeframe between two messages. My daughter (21 months old now) noticed them too: when somebody pinged me on Viber, she said "tweet-tweet, daddy", for every other noises "oh, oh! Daddy!". Their nerves are sensible for such things and I also wanted some peace, not to be distracted when I play with her or working on something. I know, I can turn on the *do not disturb* mode but then my phone vibrates for every notification and everything silenced, not only the chat platforms. So I did the followings:  
in the *system settings - Apps & notifications - Notifications* I searched for those apps I wanted to be silent and one by one set the notification sound for "None". However, there was one rebel, a tricky. Facebook Messenger.  
Because if the "None" is placed for sound, it used the one what is configured in the application. When I checked if it's possible to choose "None" there, I was surprised I couldn't. Either I turn off everything and then I really don't get anything, or I use something what isn't disturbing. No, I want to mute that while having the sliding alert from the notification bar and displaying the message on the lock screen. I had an idea: if I create an empty "sound" file (for example nothing.ogg) I might be able to set that and then nothing is played. But it didn't work; empty, 0 byte file cannot be chosen for such a purpose. Next idea: 1 sec long silence. There are a lot of such videos (?) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=1+second+silence). Downloaded one with [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/), without the visual experience, set it and voil√†, success. No more sound while having the messages on the lock screen and in the top bar.  
Now, after a week I find it very good. No more beeps, distractions, annoyances (I want to keep the touch with others, but I don't necessarily need alerts for messages). Only the calls, SMSes and e-mails aren't muted.
