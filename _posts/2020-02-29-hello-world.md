Hello and welcome to my hobby project and -blog, this is the very first entry here. The plan is to have technical and non-technical articles as well, based on my interest and current focus, furthermore it will carry my up-to-date Curriculum Vitae.
The 'About me' section will be uploaded (hopefully very) soon, but until that, let me introduce myself shortly: I'm Peter, a professional IT guy with support, OS administration (mostly Linux), virtualisation, Big Data and some marketing background and experience. I have had the chance to work with AIX 5L, RedHat Linux, VMware, Cloudera CDH components, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure. Right now I'm interested in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), security and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).  
Regarding my hobbies, I like doing different kind of sports. Nowadays I run a few kilometers when my free time allows it, previously I had experience with [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga), [MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts), weight-lifting, wall climbing and kempo.

So, let's [kick(start)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Linux)) it off.
