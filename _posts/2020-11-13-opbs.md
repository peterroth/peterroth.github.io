A few days ago I finished an other Magisk module, it aims to disable a few unnecessary packages on OnePlus devices. I'll add more things as I ensure it won't break the system, the device nor the service. You can download it from the [OnePlus Battery Saver repository](https://github.com/peterroth/OnePlusBatterySaver). The [zip file](https://github.com/peterroth/OnePlusBatterySaver/releases/download/v1.0/opbs-v1.zip) can be installed wiht Magisk's local installation (I'm pretty sure this module also won't be accepted by anyone in the Magisk repository).  
If you have ideas what else could be added or how to make this tool better, feel free to contribute and create pull requests.
