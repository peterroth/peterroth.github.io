In the recent 3 months 21 days I didn't write anything here. It is because there a few things that going on. I changed role within the company, from Customer Operation Engineer I became a Software Engineer for the Hadoop project, sustaining the released versions, backporting fixes for issues and bugs, so nowadays I learn the tricks and hows of coding, Jenkins, build systems and so on.  
In June we started to renew a big part of our house, with all the dis/advantage of it: dust, trash, broken tiles, missing parts of different things, reorders, new and fresh look, et cetera. Soon it'll be done, the next is repainting the walls and when that is also finished, I'll return and continue writing. I have ideas and a few drafts I must work on :)
