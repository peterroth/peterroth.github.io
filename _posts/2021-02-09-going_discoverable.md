So far no search crawler discovered my site. It is because I didn't spend ~~much~~ time for [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), I'm not a publicist nor journalist, writing articles in various topics is just a hobby for me; however, they might help others. So, I just enabled the jekyll-sitemap plugin, what means, search engines will find my page. Woo-hoo!  
Because I use the GitHub Pages, it could not be easier. Really. I had to edit the \_config.yml file and append "jekyll-sitemap" in the plugins section. That's it.
