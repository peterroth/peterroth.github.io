title: Volume Steps+ Magisk module

In medias res, OnePlus limits the steps of in call volumes to 7. So each step represents ~14.3% volume increase or decrease. Even on the lowest level everybody around me heard the person I had a discussion over the phone with. I searched for solutions and found I should edit the build.prop file, add 2 lines, restart the phone and done. But with Android 10 it doesn't work that way. I can copy the mentioned file to my laptop, but can't send it back. Internal protection mechanism. First, the system partition is read only, but even if I remounted it to have RW permissions, I got a "no space left on device" message when I tried to copy back to the original location. But there must be a way. And there is.  
I found an old Magisk project, called [Volume Steps Plus](https://github.com/WilomanCZ/Volume-Steps-Plus---Magisk-Module) that is intended to do what I wanted. But it isn't maintained anymore, the last commit was done on the 1st of January in 2019. So a few weeks ago I refurbished it and [applied](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/submission/issues/830) to be present in Magisk. Unfortunately it seems the only man who could accept it, [topjohnwu](https://github.com/topjohnwu), is unavailable.  
In any case, if you want to add more media- or in-call volume steps on your Android device and your phone is rooted with Magisk, download [Volume Steps+](https://github.com/peterroth/VolumeStepsPlus) and install it. Want more info? Head to [README](https://github.com/peterroth/VolumeStepsPlus/blob/master/README.md), it should tell you everything you want to know.
