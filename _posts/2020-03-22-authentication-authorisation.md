In the world of IT, [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) is something you can't go past, having the basic understanding is a must. One building block of it is authentication and authorisation; to know what do they mean, how they effect the users and what they provide for them.

### Authentication

Authentication is identifying yourself. In the real world, you have your ID card that carries your unique, [personally identifiable information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) like name, birth day and place, mother's name, etc. But you can't use your ID card on a computer, so there must be an other identifier. The most common one is a username, and to protect the account, a unique password. The goal is to prove you are who you say you are.

### Authorisation

After you are successfully authenticated, you gain access to different things; you have the authority to use resources. The system where you identified yourself provide you permission for example to print documents, browse a shared directory on the company's network, read and answer your e-mails, send a post on a forum. If you don't have the permission, you get an "Access denied", "Permission denied" or similar message. Authorisation is about what permissions you have, what can you do.

### Authentication methods

Without listing every option, I would like to list the most used ones.  
* Password: I think everybody knows it. You have a username and either a self- or a system generated password.
* Biometric authentication: nowadays it's the 2nd most used method, smartphones allow access after recognising the user's recorded fingerprint or face.
* Token: Usually companies use this method where a purpose-built physical device shows a random string or -numbers, it must be provided by the user after entering the username.
